From 2017 to 2020, I worked for the CalVal (calibration and validation) of [CFOSAT](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/calval/systematic-calval/validation-reports/swim-cfosat.html?id=1663&L=0){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (SWIM instrument). Reports and analysis are available online (see link). 

> Starting in 2018, the CFOSAT satelliteâ€™s mission will be to study the characteristics of ocean surface winds and waves. CFOSAT is a world premiere mission : simultaneous measurements of wind (SCAT) and directional spectra of ocean waves (SWIM). [...] These data will allow scientists to achieve more accurate ocean forecasts and give earlier warning of severe weather events like storms and cyclones. CFOSAT will also help climatologists to learn more about exchanges between the oceans and atmosphere, which play a key role in climate.  (Aviso Website)
