From 2017 to 2020, I worked for the CalVal (calibration and validation) of [CFOSAT](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/calval/systematic-calval/validation-reports/swim-cfosat.html?id=1663&L=0){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (SWIM instrument). Reports and analysis are available online (see link). 
> Starting in 2018, the CFOSAT satelliteâ€™s mission will be to study the characteristics of ocean surface winds and waves. CFOSAT is a world premiere mission : simultaneous measurements of wind (SCAT) and directional spectra of ocean waves (SWIM).
