> LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool and label object bounding boxes in images. It is written in Python and uses Qt for its graphical interface. Annotations are saved as XML files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used by ImageNet. Besides, it also supports YOLO and CreateML formats.

As I needed to flag difficult data for neural-network training, I added a difficult option to the open-source tool I was using.
