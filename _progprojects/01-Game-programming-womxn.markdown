> WomXn Develop At Ubisoft is a mentoring program that aims to attract and develop diverse talents for Ubisoft studios around the world.

From february to may, I was mentored by a Lead Gameplay Programmer from Ubisoft in order to prototype a game. My major focus was on the gameplay part.

Theme was Reborn, so I headed to a plateformer/puzzle where the deadbodies are the main clues to finish a level. 

__Technologies__: 
+ SFML : [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}
+ ImGui : Graphical User Interface for C++ [[lien github](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}]
