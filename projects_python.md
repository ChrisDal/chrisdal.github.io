## Hackaviz 2020 

> Raconter une histoire avec des graphiques, à partir d’un jeu de données inédit, seul ou en équipe. Les candidats ont 10 jours pour rendre leur création.

We team up with 2 co-workers to participate to a 10-days hackaviz organized by Toulouse DataViz. We wanted to present the discrepancies of tourists flux in Occitanie, thus we focus on intra-regional flux. 


__Objective__: Analyze data of tourism in Occitanie (France) in a limited time

__Technologies__: Tableau, Matplotlib, Numpy, Python

Personal contribution : I search for some primary correlation in the data with Tableau, then we can define the main axis of our storytelling. I realized the Occitanie Map Per Week that represents the flux to a focused Occitanie department and analysis. 


## Open-Source Participation 

> LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool and label object bounding boxes in images. It is written in Python and uses Qt for its graphical interface. Annotations are saved as XML files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used by ImageNet. Besides, it also supports YOLO and CreateML formats.

As I needed to flag difficult data for neural-network training, I added a difficult option to the open-source tool I was using.
