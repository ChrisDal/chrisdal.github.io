This specialization is composed of 5 courses:
1. Introduction to Game Design 
2. Story and Narrative Development for Video Games
3. Character Design for Video Games
4. World Design for Video Games
5. Game Design Document: Define the Art & Concepts

#### Introduction to Game Design 

> This an introduction to the primary concepts of gaming, and an exploration of how these basic concepts affect the way gamers interact with our games. Understand what defines a “game” and the mechanics and rules behind different types of games.

Some Example of my work: 

#### Story and Narrative Development for Video Games 

>  How storytelling acts as a vital mechanism for driving video gameplay forward. Looking at several historical and contemporary games, evaluate and interpret different story styles with the goal of identifying themes and procedures for your own game ideas. Then, examine traditional narrative story processes, such as three-act structure, and how they fit into game story flows and the strategic elements of gameplay.  Learn how to define character, setting, and structure to create a compelling game concept.

Some Example of my work: 


#### World Design For Video Games

> Explore game worlds in existing games and study the art and influences that inform their themes and styles. Investigate key components of environment and level design as well as strategies designers use to define gameplay or advance it. 

Some Example of my work: 


#### Character Design for Video Games

>  Explore concepts and approaches involved in creating successful character designs that can be applied to video games.

Some Example of my work: 

#### Game Design Document: Define the Art & Concepts

I applied the capstone-project of making a game design document on my project [9Lives](https://github.com/ChrisDal/ubiwmxn-game/tree/v2.21){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}{:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
